# Passing Arguments

> When calling methods, you can pass parameters using the 'with' keyword

We call adder with first 24 and with second 18.

> Inside the method body, you can refer to the parameters by name.

Adder writes first into sum.
Adder adds second to sum.
Adder answers with sum.

We expect that the sum is 42.

> If the name of the result variable is not clear, you can simply refer to it using the keyword 'answer'.

We expect that the answer is 42.
