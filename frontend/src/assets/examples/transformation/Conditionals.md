# Conditionals

> When you want to perform an action only if a certain condition is met,
> you can use conditional sentences.
> They use the keyword 'as', followed by a conditional expression.
> See "Testing / Relational Operators" for examples of them.
> Conditional sentences are translated to if statements in Java.

As 10 is less than 20, we write 10 into min.

There are the Students Alice and Bob with age 18 and 24.
As age of Alice is less than 21, we write "no alcohol" into state of Alice.
As age of Bob is greater equal 21, we write "old enough" into state of Bob.

> You can have multiple statements in the resulting if body by separating sentences with ',' or 'and'.

As 2 is not 3, we write 1 into x, we write 2 into y, and we write 3 into sum.

> It is not possible to create an 'else' branch in the scenario language.
> You can emulate it by inverting the condition.

As 2 is 3, we write -1 into sum.
