## Running with Docker-Compose

### Assignments

To run a local semi-production Assignment/fulibFeedback environment in a docker-compose environment, use the following command:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.assignments.yml up -d
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:11340.

## Building & Running

You can mostly set up this project after cloning using the Gradle import feature of your IDE.
Some additional steps are required and described below.

### MongoDB

Note that in order to run the server locally, you need to set up a MongoDB to run at `localhost:27017` (regular installation or Docker).

### Frontend

To set up the frontend, cd into the `frontend/` directory and run (you may need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) first):

```sh
pnpm install
```

Then, run the frontend using the launch configuration or `pnpm run start:dev`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the frontend errors along the lines of `XY is not an NgModule` or `Uncaught Error: Type XYModule does not have '…µmod' property.` similar, just restart the Angular dev server.

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:11340.
