# Loops

// Sometimes it is useful to perform the same action on multiple things at once.
// While you'd use a loop in normal programming languages, the scenario language
// provides take sentences for this purpose.
// The syntax is: We take a <name> like <example> from <list> and <sentences...>.

We write 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 into primes.

We take a prime like 1 from primes and we call someMethod with x prime.

// You can also leave out the 'like <example>' if you do not want to provide one.
// Remember to write 'an' instead of 'a' when necessary.
// You can write multiple sentences after the first 'and'.

We take an i from 1,2,3 and we call someMethod with i and we call someMethod with 0.
