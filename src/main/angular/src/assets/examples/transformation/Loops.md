# Loops

// Sometimes it is useful to perform the same action on multiple things at once.
// While you'd use a loop in normal programming languages, the scenario language
// provides take sentences for this purpose.
// The syntax is: We take a <name> like <example> from <list> and <sentences...>.

We write 1, 3, 5, 7, 11 into primes.
We write 0 into sum and we write 0 into count.

We take a prime like 1 from primes and we add prime to sum.

// You can also omit the 'like <example>' if you do not want to provide one.
// Remember to write 'an' instead of 'a' when necessary.
// You can write multiple sentences after the first 'and'.

We take an i from 1,2,3 and we add 1 to count and we add i to sum.

// You may also do it with objects:
There are Students with name Alice, Bob, Carli, and Dude.
There is a University with name Study-Right.
Study-Right has students Alice, Bob, Carli, and Dude.

We take a student from students of Study-Right and we write hello into world of student.
